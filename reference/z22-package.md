# z22: Official Gridded Data from the German Census 2022

Provides fast and easy access to German census grid data from the 2011
and 2022 censuses <https://www.zensus2022.de/>, including a wide range
of socio-economic indicators at multiple spatial resolutions (100m, 1km,
10km). Enables efficient download, processing, and analysis of large
census datasets covering population, households, families, dwellings,
and buildings. Harmonized data structures allow direct comparison with
the 2011 census, supporting temporal and spatial analyses. Facilitates
conversion of data into common formats for spatial analysis and mapping
('terra', 'sf', 'ggplot2').
