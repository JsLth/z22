    <h2 id="building-year">Building year<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#building-year"></a></h2>



<p>This characteristic indicates the <strong>year of construction</strong> of a building
with living space in microcensus classes on the respective census reference
date. The year of construction refers to the year in which the building was
completed. In the case of conversions, extensions and additions to the house,
the original year of construction of the building applies. In the case of
completely destroyed and rebuilt buildings, the year of reconstruction is
taken as the year of construction.</p>

    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="building-classifications">Building classifications<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#building-classifications"></a></h2>



<p>The census distinguishes three types of building classifications. Because
they are very close terminologically, they need clarification:</p>
<dl><dt><strong>Building size</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Originally called "building type size"
 (Gebäudetyp-Größe), this classification provides information on the
 building type in relation to its size. Categories range from detached
 single-family buildings to multi-story multi-unit buildings.</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Building type</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Originally called "building type" (Gebäudeart),
 this classification provides information about the residential use
 of residential buildings. It distinguishes buildings based on how much
 space is used for residential purposes. Categories include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Buildings with living space</strong>: Permanent buildings which
  are either fully or partially reserved for residential use by
  households. This also includes buildings used for administrative or
  commercial purposes if they contain at least one dwelling used for
  residential purposes. Buildings with living space are divided into
  residential buildings and other buildings with living space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Residential buildings</strong>: Buildings in which at least half of
  the total usable floor space is used for residential purposes. Residential
  buildings also include dormitories (where residents run their own
  household).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dormitories</strong>: Dormitories are residential buildings that
  primarily serve the housing needs of certain groups of the population
  (e.g. student residences, retirement homes). Dormitories have common
  rooms. Residents of dormitories run their own households.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other buildings with living space</strong>: Buildings in which
  less than half of the total floor space is used for residential
  purposes, e.g. because the building is predominantly occupied by
  stores or offices.</p></li>
</ul></dd>


 <dt><strong>Building design</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Originally called "building type construction
 design" (Gebäudetyp-Bauweise), this classification specifies the
 morphological design of a building, i.e. whether it is detached,
 semi-detached, terraced or something else.</p></dd>


</dl></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="citizens-citizenship">Citizens / Citizenship<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#citizens-citizenship"></a></h2>



<p>Persons with German citizenship are counted as German <strong>citizens</strong>.
When assigning citizenship, a distinction is made between persons with German
and non-German citizenship. Persons with a German citizenship are considered
to be German, regardless of the existence of other citizenships.</p>
<p>Members of the German Armed Forces, police authorities and the Foreign
Service working abroad and their families residing there are not included in
this analysis, as they cannot be assigned regionally at grid cell level in
Germany.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="core-family">Core family<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#core-family"></a></h2>



<p>This characteristic indicates the type of <strong>core family</strong> according to
national typification, i.e. according to the reference person principle,
taking into account secondary residents. A core family consists of two or
more persons belonging to the same private household and is made up of the
reference person of the private household - a central person of the private
household defined by age, marital status and gender - and at least one other
person, e.g. the partner or a child of the reference person. This family
concept restricts relationships between ancestors and descendants to direct
relationships (first degree), i.e. relationships between parents and
children. Only one core family can exist in a household. Other persons
living in the household are not assigned to a core family. A household
without a core family is possible.</p>
<p>The type of core family depends on the type of couple relationship or
the gender of the single parent, and on the presence and age (under or over
18) of children. The term marriage is not differentiated according to the
gender of the married persons. Persons in shared accommodation are not
included here, only persons who have their own household.</p>
<p>A range of terms relate to core families:</p>
<ul><li><p>A <strong>couple</strong> comprises of married couples, couples in a
 registered civil partnership and couples in a non-marital partnership
 who live together in a private household.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>married couple</strong> is a couple married according to the legal
 marital status on the reference date and living in a private household.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>registered civil partnership</strong> (ELP) is a legally
 recognized same-sex couple in a private household according to the legal
 marital status on the reference date.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>non-marital partnership</strong> (NELG) is a mixed-sex couple
 in a private household who were not married to each other according to
 their legal marital status on the reference date.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>single mother</strong> or a <strong>single father</strong> is a parent
 without a partner with at least one child within a private household.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>child</strong> is a biological son, stepson or adopted son or a
 biological daughter, stepdaughter or adopted daughter (regardless of age)
 whose usual place of residence is in the private household of at least one
 parent and one parent is the caregiver and/or partner of the caregiver.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>senior</strong> is defined as a person who has reached the
 age of 65 on the census date.</p></li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="dwelling">Dwelling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dwelling"></a></h2>



<p>A <strong>dwelling</strong> is defined as rooms that are closed off from the outside,
intended for residential purposes, usually located together, which enable
the management of a separate household and are not used entirely for
commercial purposes.</p>
<p>A dwelling does not necessarily have to contain a kitchen or kitchenette.
Apartments have their own entrance directly from the outside, from a
stairwell or a vestibule. However, a dwelling may also include basement or
floor rooms (e.g. attics) that are developed for residential purposes
outside the actual end of the dwelling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="floor-space">Floor space<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#floor-space"></a></h2>



<p>To determine the <strong>floor space</strong>, the following areas are taken into
account:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>full</strong>: floor areas of rooms or parts of rooms with a clear
 height of at least 2 meters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>half</strong>: floor areas of rooms or parts of rooms with a clear
 height of at least 1 meter but less than 2 meters; unheatable observatories,
 swimming pools, and similar rooms closed on all sides</p></li>
<li><p><strong>generally a quarter, but no more than half</strong>: areas of
 balconies, loggias, roof gardens, terraces</p></li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="foreigners">Foreigners<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#foreigners"></a></h2>



<p>Persons with a non-German nationality are counted as <strong>foreigners</strong>.
When assigning nationality, a distinction is made between persons with German
and non-German nationality. Persons with German citizenship are considered
German, regardless of the existence of other citizenships.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="household">Household<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#household"></a></h2>



<p>A private <strong>household</strong> consists of at least one person. This is based
on the "concept of communal living": all persons who live together in
dwelling, regardless of their residential status (sole residence, main or
secondary residence), are considered members of the same private household,
meaning that there is one private household per occupied dwelling. There
is a maximum of one core family in a household. Other persons living in the
household are not assigned to a core family.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="heating-type">Heating type<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#heating-type"></a></h2>



<p>The characteristic reflects the <strong>type of heating</strong> in the building. This
evaluation is carried out for dwellings. The predominant type of heating
in the building is broken down according to which spatial unit (district,
building block, building, dwelling, room) is heated by the heating system.
In passive houses, systems for heat recovery/controlled ventilation systems
are considered "heating" and are assigned accordingly (usually: central
heating).</p>
<dl><dt><strong>District heating</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Here, entire residential districts are supplied
 with heat from a central district heating plant (so-called district
 heating).</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Self-contained central heating</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Self-contained central
 heating refers to a central heating system for all rooms in a self-contained
 dwelling, whereby the heating source (for example, gas boiler) is usually
 located within this dwelling.</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Block heating</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Block heating is when a block of entire houses is
 heated by a central heating system and the heating source is located in
 or on one of the buildings or in its immediate vicinity (so-called local
 heating).</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Central heating</strong></dt>
<dd><p>With central heating, all the residential units in
 a building are heated from a central heating point located within the
 building (usually in the basement). This also includes heat pumps.</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Single or multi-room stoves</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Individual stoves (such as coal or
 night storage stoves) only heat the room in which they are located at any
 one time. They are usually permanently installed. A multi-room stove (e.g.
 tiled stove) heats several rooms at the same time (also through air ducts).
 No heating in the building or in the dwellings</p></dd>


</dl></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="marital-status">Marital status<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marital-status"></a></h2>



<p>The <strong>marital status</strong> indicates a person's marital status under
personal law. The marital status under personal law is determined in
accordance with the Personenstandsgesetz (PStG) and the
Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz (LPartG).</p>
<p>The introduction of the right to marriage for persons of the same
sex (Eheöffnungsgesetz) has allowed same-sex couples to marry since October
1, 2017. The establishment of new registered civil partnerships under the
Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz (LPartG) has no longer
been possible since October 1, 2017. Unless existing civil partnerships are
converted into a marriage, registered civil partnerships remain in place.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="net-rent">Net rent<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-rent"></a></h2>



<p>The average <strong>net rent</strong> per square meter is the ratio between the total rent
per square meter of the dwellings and the total number of dwellings. The
calculation is made for rented dwellings in residential buildings
(excluding dormitories). Dwellings not rented out are excluded from
the calculation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="ownership">Ownership<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ownership"></a></h2>



<p>Ownership is divided into <strong>home ownership</strong> and
<strong>property ownership</strong>. Home ownership determines who is entitled to
ownership of a dwelling in a building divided according to the
Wohneigentumsgesetz (WEG) while property ownership determines who is entitled
to ownership in a building. Owners can be private individuals or legal
entities.</p>
<p>The <strong>ownership rate</strong> represents the share of owner-occupied dwellings
in all occupied dwellings. Not taken into account: Vacant dwellings,
vacation and leisure dwellings and commercially used dwellings. The
calculation is made for dwellings in residential buildings (excluding
halls of residence).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="place-of-birth">Place of birth<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#place-of-birth"></a></h2>



<p>Persons born up to August 2, 1945 in former German eastern territories
within the borders of Germany in 1937 are not counted as born abroad, but
are assigned the German state code. If the <strong>place of birth</strong> is not
within these borders, the current state code is assigned. Places of birth in
countries that have merged into other countries, such as the Soviet Union
or Yugoslavia, are assigned to the countries that exist today wherever
possible.</p>

 2022, previously last amended by the UK's withdrawal in 2020. Persons born in
 Czechoslovakia are also included in "EU27 country (as of 2020)" with the
 current country codes. Croatia is also included here following its accession
 to the EU on July 1, 2013.</p></dd>


 <dt><strong>Other Europe</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Includes the Russian Federation and Turkey as well as
 other current country codes of the former Soviet Union and the former
 Yugoslavia. Great Britain is assigned here following its withdrawal

</dl></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="residents">Residents<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#residents"></a></h2>



<p>Each <strong>resident</strong> is assigned to an <strong>address</strong> and thus to a
grid cell with a side length of 100 m, 1 km or 10 km. Members of the German
Armed Forces, police authorities and the Foreign Service working abroad and
their families living there are not included in this analysis, as they cannot
be assigned regionally at grid cell level in Germany.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="room">Room<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#room"></a></h2>



<p>A <strong>room</strong> is either a living room, dining room, bedroom or other
separate room (e.g. habitable cellar or floor rooms) of at least 6 square
meters in size as well as self-contained kitchens, regardless of their
size. Bathrooms, toilets, hallways and utility rooms are generally not
counted. A living room with a dining area, sleeping alcove or kitchenette
is to be counted as one room. Accordingly, dwellings in which there is no
structural separation of the individual living areas (e.g. so-called
"loft dwellings") consist of only one room.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="source-of-heating">Source of heating<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#source-of-heating"></a></h2>



<p>The characteristic shows the energy <strong>source of the heating</strong> in the building.
This evaluation is carried out for dwellings. Energy source used to heat
the building. If there are several energy sources in the building, it is the
one that heats the largest part of the living space. In passive houses, the
residual heat requirement is covered by an additional source, which is
specified here.</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Gas</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heating oil</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wood, wood pellets</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biomass (excluding wood), biogas</strong>: All organic substances produced by
 plants or animals from which energy can be obtained by burning. Energy can
 be obtained through combustion. This includes straw, organic waste or
 liquid manure (excluding wood). Biogas is produced during the fermentation
 of biomass and is also classified here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solar/geothermal energy, environmental heat, exhaust air heat</strong>:
 Solar energy as well as energy from water, air and earth is obtained here
 with the help of collectors, heat pumps and heat exchangers. This also
 includes heat obtained from the exhaust air of buildings (so-called exhaust
 air heat).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Electricity (without heat pumps)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coal</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>District heating (various heating sources)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No energy source (no heating)</strong></p></li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="vacancy">Vacancy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vacancy"></a></h2>



<p>The <strong>vacancy rate</strong> (dwellings) represents the ratio of vacant dwelligngs
to all occupied and vacant dwellings. The market-active vacancy rate
represents the proportion of vacant dwellings that are available again
within three months as a percentage of all dwellings in residential
buildings. Not taken into account: Vacation and leisure dwellings as well as
commercially used dwellings. The calculation is made for dwellings in
residential buildings (excluding halls of residence).</p>
