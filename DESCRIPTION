Description: Provides fast and easy access to German census grid data
    from the 2011 and 2022 censuses <https://www.zensus2022.de/>, including a
    wide range of socio-economic indicators at multiple spatial resolutions
    (100m, 1km, 10km). Enables efficient download, processing, and analysis
    of large census datasets covering population, households, families,
    dwellings, and buildings. Harmonized data structures allow direct
    comparison with the 2011 census, supporting temporal and spatial analyses.
    Facilitates conversion of data into common formats for spatial analysis and
    mapping ('terra', 'sf', 'ggplot2').
