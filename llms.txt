# z22

As part of the German census, a number of socio-economic indicators are
published at a small-scale grid level (100m, 1km, 10km). Usually the
corresponding data files are very large and hard to work with.
[z22](https://github.com/jslth/z22/) aims to quickly and efficiently
retrieve German census grid data. The package also eases comparisons to
grid data from the census 2011 by establishing a standardized feature
format.

Powered by the [z22data](https://github.com/jslth/z22data) data
repository which hosts the census grid data in small and digestible
chunks. Based on the predecessor package
[z11](https://github.com/stefanjuenger/z11/) which allows easy access to
the gridded data from the Census 2011.

## Installation

You can install the development version of z22 like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("jslth/z22")
```

## Example

The package contains a main function, `z22_data`, to retrieve and
process census grid data. The following example downloads a feature grid
on the vacancy share in Germany at a 1x1 km resolution.

``` r
library(z22)
library(terra)

grid_vac <- z22_data("vacancies", res = "10km", as = "raster")
grid_vac
#> class       : SpatRaster 
#> dimensions  : 87, 65, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)
#> resolution  : 10000, 10000  (x, y)
#> extent      : 4035000, 4685000, 2685000, 3555000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
#> coord. ref. : ETRS89-extended / LAEA Europe (EPSG:3035) 
#> source(s)   : memory
#> name        : cat_0 
#> min value   :  1.34 
#> max value   : 22.51
```

Code for the plot

``` r
library(ggplot2)

df_vac <- z22_pivot_longer(grid_vac, "vacancies")
ggplot(df_vac) +
  geom_tile(aes(x, y, fill = value)) +
  coord_sf(crs = 3035) + 
  facet_wrap(~category, nrow = 2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c("Share", na.value = "transparent", transform = "log2") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())
```
